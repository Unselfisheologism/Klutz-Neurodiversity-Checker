# **App Name**: NeuroCheck

## Core Features:

- Image Analysis: Analyze uploaded images (PNG, JPG, etc.) using GPT-4 Vision via Puter's AI API to check for neurodiversity-friendliness. The tool should consider aspects like color contrast, visual complexity, and pattern density based on the Puter documentation.
- Text Analysis: Analyze uploaded text files (PDF, DOC, TXT, etc.) using GPT-4o via Puter's AI API to check for neurodiversity-friendliness. The tool should analyze readability, clarity, and potential for misinterpretation, referencing Puter documentation for best practices.
- File Upload and Display: Implement a drag-and-drop interface and clipboard paste functionality for easy uploading of images and text files. Only one type of file (image or text) can be selected for analysis at a time. Display analysis results clearly.
